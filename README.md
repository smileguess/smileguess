## State Diagram

```javascript
let sampleState = {

  user: {
    id: 5, // unique user id
    username: 'bob', // username
    points: 555, // points in current game
    wins: 3, // wins in current game
    emojicoins: 3, // total number of emojicoins across games
    picture: 'http://cdn.photonesta.com/image.png', // user profile pic
  },

  /* There is one part of the store for holding game information.  This is so
   * that updates from the server to this part of the store can happen in a simple way.
   * The server will have pre-configured an action to be integrated wholesale into the store.
   */

      * - players.all: This is an object where the userids map to key/value objects
      *   which represent players in the current game.
      * - players.byId: This is an array of ids of all the users in the game.
